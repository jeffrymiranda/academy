## SOLID Principals

SOLID design principles help make software stable and flexible. In this project, you’ll learn about the five SOLID design
principles for software development, which are Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, 
Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle. You’ll then explore the use of each of the five SOLID 
principles in code.
